## About

**MSN Messenger**, later rebranded as **Windows Live Messenger**, was a cross-platform instant messaging client developed by Microsoft. It was first released in 1999 and discontinued in 2013.

This project aims to visually recreate the beloved application of our childhood. It was built as a learning experience and as a tribute to nostalgic users like me. I had so much fun coding it, researching, and recovering original assets to make it as authentic as possible.

I hope you enjoy it as much as I did creating it! 😊

The initial idea was to add "fake" contacts (AI bots) to replicate the MSN experience. For now, I don’t have the time or motivation to develop a real chat application—but who knows, maybe in the future!

As a junior developer, I kindly ask for your understanding if the application has bugs or missing features. I’m aware it’s not perfect, and I do my best to fix issues as they come up.

### Fotolog

`/fotolog` redirects to the signed-in user's named URL, such as `/fotolog/ana-perez`.
Names are normalized and duplicate URLs receive a numeric suffix. Profile renames
create a new URL while previous URLs and numeric links keep working. Accounts are
still scoped to the same company/event. Includes a daily photo (one
per calendar day in `ADMIN_TIMEZONE`), photo archive/permalinks, guestbook
comments, user search, favorites, and per-profile colors/banner/background.
Uploads accept JPEG, PNG, WebP and GIF files up to 500 KB. Images and profile
settings persist in PostgreSQL, using the additive tables in `server/schema.sql`
(applied when the API starts). Nginx proxies the Fotolog API endpoints while
keeping profile URLs as frontend routes.

Validate the local API with `FOTOLOG_INTEGRATION=1 node --test server/fotolog.integration.test.js`
after `npm run server:local`. Integration fixtures are removed after the test.
